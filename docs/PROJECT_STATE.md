- Phase 0 acceptance gate: PASS

These validations establish the build and repository
foundation only. They do not test a TCP server,
Redis commands, storage, persistence or recovery.

These are foundation tests only.

No event-loop, RESP2, database, persistence or
benchmark tests have been executed.

### Phase 1A — 2026-10-19

- Apple Clang C++20 Debug build: PASS
- Apple Clang C++20 Release build: PASS
- Debug tests: 3/3 PASS
- Release tests: 3/3 PASS
- Dedicated UniqueFd test: PASS
- Repeated UniqueFd test: 25/25 PASS

- Scope-based descriptor cleanup test: PASS
- Move construction and assignment tests: PASS
- release/reset ownership tests: PASS
- clang-format: PASS
- CMake integration and staged file-set checks: PASS

These tests validate file-descriptor ownership on macOS.
They are not evidence of a working TCP listener,
Linux portability, or complete networking correctness.

### Phase 1B — 2026-10-19

- Apple Clang C++20 Debug build: PASS
- Debug automated tests: 4/4 PASS
- Apple Clang C++20 Release build: PASS

- Loopback IPv4 bind and ephemeral port: PASS
- Listener O_NONBLOCK and FD_CLOEXEC: PASS
- Empty non-blocking accept: PASS
- Accepted client socket flags: PASS
- Real TCP send/receive: PASS
- Four queued client connections: PASS
- Move construction, assignment and RAII cleanup: PASS
- Invalid backlog handling: PASS
- Duplicate listener bind handling: PASS
- Invalid moved-from listener handling: PASS
- CMake integration and staged file review: PASS

Scope: macOS loopback component tests only.
The server executable still has no TCP serving loop.
Linux validation, event multiplexing and RESP2 are pending.

### Phase 1C — 2026-10-19

- Apple Clang C++20 Debug build: PASS
- Debug automated tests: 5/5 PASS
- Apple Clang C++20 Release build: PASS
- Release automated tests: 5/5 PASS
- Direct EventPoller interface test: PASS

- Duplicate live registration rejection: PASS
- Stable live registration tokens: PASS
- Simulated stale token filtering: PASS
- Timeout argument validation: PASS
- FD ownership separation using socketpair: PASS
- clang-format: PASS
- CMake integration and staged file review: PASS

Scope: Header-only interface and test-double validation.
The test double injects events; it does not monitor
kernel readiness or actually wait for timeouts.
Token uniqueness across successive registration
lifetimes remains a caller responsibility.
Native kqueue/epoll, running event loop, and
connection dispatch are not yet implemented.

### Phase 1D — 2026-10-19

- Native macOS kqueue source compilation: PASS
- Apple Clang C++20 Debug build: PASS
- Debug automated tests: 6/6 PASS
- Apple Clang C++20 Release build: PASS
- Release automated tests: 6/6 PASS
- Direct native kqueue test: PASS
- Repeated native kqueue integration test: 15/15 PASS

- Real socket read readiness: PASS
- Real socket write readiness: PASS
- Read/write filter modification: PASS
- Multiple registration token delivery: PASS
- Duplicate registration and invalid argument checks: PASS

- Infinite wait awakened by socket data: PASS
- Peer hangup detection: PASS
- Native TCP listener readiness: PASS
- Poller does not own registered sockets: PASS
- Source formatting: PASS
- CMake integration and exact staged file set: PASS

Scope: Native macOS kqueue component validation.
The tests exercise real kernel readiness notifications.
They do not establish Linux epoll behavior, complete
error-injection coverage, or a running database server.

### Phase 1E — 2026-10-19

- Linux platform: Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64.
- Linux compiler: GCC 13.3.0.
- Linux Debug build: PASS.
- Linux Debug automated tests: 6/6 PASS.
- Linux Release build: PASS.
- Linux Release automated tests: 6/6 PASS.
- Debug epoll repeated integration test: 15/15 PASS.

- GitHub Actions run: 39233458374 SUCCESS.
- macOS Debug regression tests: 6/6 PASS.
- macOS Release regression tests: 6/6 PASS.
- C++ formatting and file-set validation: PASS.

Native epoll was executed on an actual Linux kernel
using GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners. This does not
establish Linux ARM64 compatibility or a running
database server. The connection lifecycle and
continuous serving loop remain unimplemented.

### Phase 1F — 2026-10-19

Implementation checkpoints:

- 1F-A/B: c8ec996.
- 1F-C: 50ead92.
- 1F-D: 6881b04 and f5bdacc.
- 1F-E.1: a01ae98.
- 1F-E.1b: 51a363b.

Verified results:

- macOS Debug: 9/9 tests passed.
- macOS Release: 9/9 tests passed.
- macOS dispatch integration: 20/20 repetitions passed.
- Linux Debug full test suite: PASS.
- Linux Release full test suite: PASS.
- Linux connection-manager test: 20/20 repetitions per configuration.
- Linux connection-dispatch test: 20/20 repetitions per configuration.
- Linux native epoll repetitions: PASS.
- Linux test discovery: exactly two lifecycle tests selected.
- GitHub Actions: 39256465515 SUCCESS.
- PR #2: MERGED on 2026-10-19.
- Merge commit: 290bc71035bbaa0e93a6c0d12a228f7eb9ff4427.
- Post-merge Linux CI: 39271745832 SUCCESS.
- Phase 1F acceptance: COMPLETE.
- Phase 1G: COMPLETE.

The networking library is implemented and tested.
The executable continuously serves multiple clients
only in explicit transport smoke mode.
Redis commands remain unimplemented.

### Phase 1G — 2026-10-19

Feature branch: `phase1g/multi-client-smoke`.
PR #3: MERGED on 2026-10-19.
Merge commit: adf021060d7b758ce9224d7d4ac8fe6ed8841b75.

Committed checkpoints:

- 1G-C: 4b94fac — Native smoke serving and external TCP tests.
- 1G-D: f7ed0d5 — Accept-time reset isolation, additional
  process tests and deterministic fairness-test setup.

Verified macOS results:

- Debug full CTest suite: 10/10 PASS.
- Release full CTest suite: 10/10 PASS.
- Dispatch integration: 100/100 repetitions per configuration.
- External smoke: 10/10 repetitions per configuration.
- Full Release suite: five consecutive successful runs.
- C++ formatting: PASS.
- Local/remote feature-branch HEAD: synchronized.
- Working tree after implementation push: CLEAN.

The abrupt-reset test exposed a macOS accepted-socket
initialization failure. A peer-specific exception is now
handled during admission without terminating the server.
The existing fairness test was updated to wait for actual
kernel listener and healthy-client readiness.

Linux workflow 39283579738: FAILED due to
malformed shell line continuations in the smoke
repetition step. Full suites had passed.

The workflow was corrected in commit 3db387d.

Linux workflow 39288146570: SUCCESS.

Verified for BOTH Linux Debug and Release:

- Full automated suite: 10/10 PASS.
- External TCP smoke: 10/10 repetitions.
- Connection manager: 20/20 repetitions.
- Connection dispatch: 20/20 repetitions.
- Native epoll: 15/15 repetitions.
- Executable version verification: PASS.

Linux implementation acceptance: PASS.

Final PR-head Linux CI: 39289273326 SUCCESS.
PR #3: MERGED.
Merge commit: adf021060d7b758ce9224d7d4ac8fe6ed8841b75.
Post-merge Linux CI: 39290777669 SUCCESS.

Both Debug and Release on the merged macOS main
passed all 10 CTest tests. Main was synchronized
with origin/main and the worktree was clean.

Phase 1G: COMPLETE.
Phase 1 Networking Foundation: COMPLETE.
Phase 2A: NEXT, NOT STARTED.

No RESP2, database commands, storage or persistence
have been implemented.

## 11. Benchmarks

NOT STARTED.

No operations-per-second, latency or memory
performance claims are currently supported.

## 12. Deployment State

- Linux build: VALIDATED on Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 in Debug and Release; deployment not started
- Docker packaging: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Local container test: NOT STARTED
- Remote Linux deployment: NOT STARTED
- Persistent remote storage: NOT CONFIGURED
- Remote restart recovery: NOT TESTED

Mandatory Milestone A: Phase 15.
Planned Milestone B: Phase 16.

## 13. Architecture Decisions

Approved architecture:

- C++20 and CMake.
- Non-blocking TCP sockets.
- kqueue on macOS.
- epoll on Linux.
- Single-threaded initial command execution.
- Incremental RESP2 parser.
- Hash-table-backed keyspace.
- Lazy and active expiration.
- Data-memory limits and eviction.
- Append-only persistence.
- Versioned snapshots.
- Crash recovery.
- Documented Redis-compatible command subset.

See `docs/DECISIONS.md` for the accepted architecture decisions.

Approved decisions are not proof of implementation.

## 14. Known Issues and Risks

### Low Disk Space

The initial audit reported about 12 GiB free.

Docker data was approximately 52 GiB.

Do not delete Docker data or existing project
resources without inspecting them first.

Recover additional space before heavy Linux,
Docker, sanitizer or persistence workloads.

### Docker Engine

Docker CLI is installed.

The engine was not running during Phase 0A.

Container validation is deferred.

### Platform Portability

Local platform is macOS arm64.

Linux epoll and connection lifecycle tests have passed on Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64. Linux ARM64 and deployment remain untested.

### Compatibility

Full Redis compatibility is not a project goal.

Only implemented and validated commands may be
advertised as supported.

### Durability

Persistence is not yet implemented.

Do not claim crash safety until fault-injection and
recovery testing has been completed.

## 15. Development Rules

- Use macOS Terminal commands.
- Inspect files and Git status before modification.
- Avoid manual editor-based implementation.
- Prefer complete-file heredocs or guarded patches.
- Implement one controlled milestone at a time.
- Validate before committing.
- Use Conventional Commits.
- Push validated milestones.
- Verify local and remote HEAD.
- Never overwrite uncommitted work.
- Never fabricate tests, benchmarks or deployments.
- Update this file after meaningful milestones.

## 16. Exact Next Steps

Phase 1 networking work has passed its acceptance gate
and was merged through PR #3.

1. Verify this Phase 1 closure checkpoint is committed,
   pushed and synchronized with origin/main.
2. Verify the post-closure documentation CI result.
3. Start Phase 2A from the clean current main branch.
4. Create a dedicated Phase 2A feature branch.
5. Inspect the existing C++ source and protocol ADR.
6. Define the RESP2 value model and ownership invariants.
7. Specify binary-safe strings, arrays, integers and
   error/simple-string response representations.
8. Decide error handling, resource bounds and test cases.
9. Implement and validate Phase 2A in isolation.
10. Commit, push and update the project-state record.

Phase 2A is NOT STARTED at this checkpoint.

The executable currently supports only an explicit
transport-level TCP echo smoke mode.
It is not a functioning Redis database.

## 17. Continuation Instructions

On a new chat:

1. Read docs/PROJECT_STATE.md.
2. Read docs/ROADMAP.md.
3. Read docs/DECISIONS.md.
4. Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
5. Inspect git status and recent commits.
6. Verify the actual repository state.
7. Check current test results.
8. Continue from the exact next incomplete subphase.

Do not assume an unverified milestone is complete.

Project priority:

Correctness -> Reliability -> Measured Performance
-> Deployment -> Portfolio Presentation
