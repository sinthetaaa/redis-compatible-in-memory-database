## 6. Implemented Architecture

### Implemented

- CMake-based C++20 project.
- Debug and Release Ninja presets.
- Static redisdb-core library.
- redisdb-server executable.
- redisdb-tests executable.
- CLI version and help responses.
- Basic automated test registration.
- Compiler warning configuration.
- clang-format configuration.

### Not Yet Implemented

- TCP sockets and listener.
- kqueue and epoll.
- Multiple client connections.
- RESP2 parser and serializer.
- Command execution.
- In-memory key-value database.
- Expiration.
- Eviction.
- Append-only persistence.
- Snapshotting and recovery.
- Observability.
- Deployment.

## 7. Supported Commands

No Redis database commands have been implemented.

Currently available executable options:

- --version
- --help

These are bootstrap CLI options, not RESP commands.

## 8. Persistence Guarantees

NOT IMPLEMENTED.

No durability or crash-recovery guarantees exist yet.

## 9. Files Created

### Phase 0C

- .clang-format
- .gitignore
- CMakeLists.txt
- CMakePresets.json
- include/redisdb/server/Version.hpp
- src/server/Version.cpp
- src/main.cpp
- tests/unit/version_test.cpp

### Phase 0D

- README.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md
- docs/PROJECT_STATE.md
- docs/DECISIONS.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

- Release build: PASS
- Release tests: 2/2 PASS

These validations establish the build and repository
foundation only. They do not test a TCP server,
Redis commands, storage, persistence or recovery.

These are foundation tests only.

No networking, database, persistence or benchmark
tests have been executed.

## 11. Benchmarks

NOT STARTED.

No operations-per-second, latency or memory
performance claims are currently supported.

## 12. Deployment State

- Linux build: NOT VALIDATED
- Docker packaging: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Local container test: NOT STARTED
- Remote Linux deployment: NOT STARTED
- Persistent remote storage: NOT CONFIGURED
- Remote restart recovery: NOT TESTED

Mandatory Milestone A: Phase 15.
Planned Milestone B: Phase 16.

## 13. Architecture Decisions

Approved architecture:

- C++20 and CMake.
- Non-blocking TCP sockets.
- kqueue on macOS.
- epoll on Linux.
- Single-threaded initial command execution.
- Incremental RESP2 parser.
- Hash-table-backed keyspace.
- Lazy and active expiration.
- Data-memory limits and eviction.
- Append-only persistence.
- Versioned snapshots.
- Crash recovery.
- Documented Redis-compatible command subset.

See `docs/DECISIONS.md` after Phase 0D completion.

Approved decisions are not proof of implementation.

## 14. Known Issues and Risks

### Low Disk Space

The initial audit reported about 12 GiB free.

Docker data was approximately 52 GiB.

Do not delete Docker data or existing project
resources without inspecting them first.

Recover additional space before heavy Linux,
Docker, sanitizer or persistence workloads.

### Docker Engine

Docker CLI is installed.

The engine was not running during Phase 0A.

Container validation is deferred.

### Platform Portability

Local platform is macOS arm64.

Linux epoll and Linux runtime behavior remain untested.

### Compatibility

Full Redis compatibility is not a project goal.

Only implemented and validated commands may be
advertised as supported.

### Durability

Persistence is not yet implemented.

Do not claim crash safety until fault-injection and
recovery testing has been completed.

## 15. Development Rules

- Use macOS Terminal commands.
- Inspect files and Git status before modification.
- Avoid manual editor-based implementation.
- Prefer complete-file heredocs or guarded patches.
- Implement one controlled milestone at a time.
- Validate before committing.
- Use Conventional Commits.
- Push validated milestones.
- Verify local and remote HEAD.
- Never overwrite uncommitted work.
- Never fabricate tests, benchmarks or deployments.
- Update this file after meaningful milestones.

## 16. Exact Next Steps

1. Verify and push the Phase 0E completion checkpoint.
2. Start Phase 1A — RAII Socket Abstraction.
3. Inspect the current CMake and source organization.
4. Define move-only file-descriptor ownership semantics.
5. Implement guarded resource acquisition and cleanup.
6. Add tests for ownership transfer and error paths.
7. Validate Debug and Release builds.
8. Update project-state documentation.
9. Commit and push the validated Phase 1A milestone.
10. Continue to Phase 1B only after the 1A gate passes.

## 17. Continuation Instructions

On a new chat:

1. Read docs/PROJECT_STATE.md.
2. Read docs/ROADMAP.md.
3. Read docs/DECISIONS.md.
4. Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
5. Inspect git status and recent commits.
6. Verify the actual repository state.
7. Check current test results.
8. Continue from the exact next incomplete subphase.

Do not assume an unverified milestone is complete.

Project priority:

Correctness -> Reliability -> Measured Performance
-> Deployment -> Portfolio Presentation
